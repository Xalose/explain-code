Start with C++
head file
A head file is a unique characteristic of C++, it’s like a tool or a dlc for your program. Each head file contains a specific function and could help the program achieve a different purpose. For instance, an iostream head file could help C++ users to input and output. The Maths head file could help c++ to calculate different staff. This is similar to Java in that it can import other extensions to make the program more powerful.


name space
name space is specific in C++ programming, it deals with the issue that when two or more programs integrate together, the system may get obscure figuring which version of the function(name) it should use. For example, in two programs, there could be a function called “wanda”, however, these two functions could be different in how they function. The function in program 1 could mean add two numbers together, program 2 could mean add a name into a name list. When integrating, the  program may not know which “wandaP” it should use during compiling, so a namespace gives the program certain space to store the name, and each function then has its own name for the program to choose to use.


function
function is the framework of C++ and is the first step for a program to complete an action. In order to run a program successfully, you need a main function where the compiler starts to compile and complete any action you want it to do. Every function should have a return in the program, if you do not need any return value you should write return 0 to let the program end. In the function, you can let the program print sth on the screen, or you can let it rank the height of students using a list of students’ heights descendingly.  It really depends what you’ve written in the program. 

variable
variable is a “thing” you create for this program only. For example, if your pet weighs 5 kg, then you can create a variable called  petweight, and this variable will equal to 5 to represent that your pet has 5 kg weight.  Every variable has its own data type, like the dog weighs 5kg so the variable petweight should be an integer instead of a String or Boolean.

The most common variables are:
integer: the numbers 1,2,3,4 etc
String: the normal words are all regarded as string, such as “Class” , “STUDENT”,  combinations with letters and numbers are also included in this data type.
Boolean: Boolean is special in computer language, it determines whether an action is true or wrong, and asks computers to do things depending on the condition. For instance, Kevin may ride a bike if the weather is sunny, or go to school by car if it is raining, we could therefore define a variable called ifraining using boolean data type. If this variable is equal to true, it means today is raining, so Kevin need to go to school by car, if this variable is equal to false, it means today is not raining and Kevin could ride a bike to school.

There are many other variables that are used quite often but not as usually as the staff I previously introduce, for example:
SHORT 
Double
Long 
Long Long

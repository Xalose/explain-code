head file

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
#include <windows.h>
// this is headfiles in C++. the headfile iostream is used by the program to output any data that has previously created. 
//the cmath is used for complex symbols for math such as log, sin, cos etc.
//the window.h is unique in windows system due to the feature of operating system. Using this headfile could help 
//you do actions like stop the program in a period of time.


names space:
using namespace std;
// this is an example of namespace. If you want to use it than just copy the previous line

class:
int main(){

return 0;
}
// this is the format of how to write a main class in C++, for every program to run it must have a main class.



int a=();
char b=();
boolean c=();
longlong d=();
string e=();
double x=();
float y=();
// this is how you construct different variables. For each variables you need to define its name and datatype.
//For example, at the first line I created a variable called a and I set its datatype as int. same with the other ones.
